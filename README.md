## How it works
 - Spotify generate Discover Weekly playlist like [this](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZEVXcWlsrx2rT0bU?si=2f332d0c91bb4362) with unique tracks for each user.
 - But once playlist is regenerated all old track that you like in DW playlist will disappear
 - You can save them manually if you don't forget
 - OR use this service
